# quarto-academic-website
A template for a basic academic website made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
It is meant to be a starting point for a Quarto based website, as Quarto has many more options than what is shown here.

The website contains:

- Home page
  - profile picture
  - icons for links to Github, etc.
- About page
- Research page
  - Automatically lists paper/project pages in the "research/" folder
- CV pdf

## How to Use

Click "Use this template".

## Customization

- First, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

Add your own "profile.jpg" and "cv.pdf" to the repository.
Then edit the text and options in each ".qmd" file.
The "_quarto.yml" controls some site-wide settings, like the navbar links.
You can create new papers in the listing by adding new ".qmd" files to the "research/" folder.
Change the "favicon" by replacing "logo.png" with a new image.
You can generate favicons at [favicon.io](https://favicon.io).
You just need one of the png files, not all of the versions.
