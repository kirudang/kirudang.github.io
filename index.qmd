## Research Overview

My research explores the intersection of **Trustworthy AI** and **Privacy-Preserving Technologies**, aiming to develop mechanisms that enhance the **security**, **privacy**, and **robustness** of large language models. I collaborate with industry and academic partners to deploy and evaluate adversarial robustness, watermarking techniques, and privacy-preserving frameworks in real-world AI systems.
